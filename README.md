### Programs:
    # 1 BMI Calculator 🧮
    - By recent estimates, two-thirds of the people in the United States are overweight 
    and about half of those are obese.

    To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, 
    you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). 
    
    # 2 MobileTest 📱
    - Write java program to create two classes Mobile and MobileTest. 
    
    Mobile class contains data fields company (e.g. Samsung, Nokia,…etc), model (J1, A1, X1…etc), 
    On (true or false), memory , hasCamera (true or false) and volume(range from 0 -10) and methods   
    two constructors ( one no argument and another with arguments), switchOn(), switchoff(), increaseVolume(), 
    decreaseVolume() and get and set methods for each data fields (getCompany(), setCompany(), 
    getModel(), setModel()……etc)
    
    MobileTest class will contains one method main(). In  main method  create object of 
    Mobile and write menu driven program to input mobile details, display mobile details, 
    change volume and  switch on or off mobile
    
    # 3 DoM Application ☀️☔️❄️

     2. Maintain city wise yearly (from January to December) rainfall information.
     3. Display yearly climate data for city.
     
    # 4 Product Demo Application 📺📲
    Topics covered: Abstract Class, Interface & Polymorphism
    
    - Write Java Program to implement following class diagram. 
    In main method of ProductDemo class you have demonstrate polymorphism. 
    
    Special Instructions-
     1.	Program should be well commented.
     2.	Program should be easy to use.
     3.	Data Validation should be done. 
     e.g. channel range (1-100), volume range (0-10), product should be 
     on when you change volume or channel or sim change
     4.	Add necessary constructors, attributes and member functions if required.
